## Code Structure
How will the code be divided in the front-end and back-end/API so it can be given as a task to people with each role.
The Contact Manager should do the following:
1. Login an existing user
2. Create a new user
3. Create a new contact for a user
4. Search for a specific contact with a button 
5. (He might have mentioned something like this) Search for a contact by just inserting a portion of the name
6. Delete a new contact (with a dialogue box making sure the user wants to delete the contact)
7. Update contact information
